# Computational Memory Lab Website

A modern redesign of the [Computational Memory Lab](https://www.psych.ualberta.ca/~cml/) website at the University of Alberta.

## About the Lab

The Computational Memory Lab, directed by Dr. Jeremy B. Caplan, investigates human verbal memory behaviour and its basis in cognitive and neural processes. The lab employs mathematical modeling, cognitive psychology techniques, and brain imaging (EEG and fMRI) to study:

- How competing associations affect memory
- Memory encoding strategies (associative chaining vs. positional coding)
- Voluntary mnemonic strategies
- Brain oscillations and their role in memory

## Development

This site is hosted via GitHub Pages from the `/docs` folder.
